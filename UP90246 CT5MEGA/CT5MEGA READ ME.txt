For my artefact, my project involves controlling a character from the camera's perspective where you have the ability to pick up an object 
and be able to rotate them using inputs from the keyboard. I decided to work this idea because it would be good practice with 
using quaternions that allows for the objects to be rotated. I also added objects that act as collectible coins for the player to pick up, 
that will also be rotating, similar to how rings spin in Sonic the Hedgehog games.

Player Controls:
W- Forward
A- Left
S- Back
D- Right

Move the mouse to rotate the camera.

Object rotation controls:
Up arrow key: up
Left arrow key: left
Right arrow key:right 
Down arrow key: down
